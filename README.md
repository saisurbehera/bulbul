# Bulbula


### Why the name ?

This project is named after the vibrant ବୁଲବୁଲା (Bulabulā), affectionately known as the Indian bulbul. These spirited songbirds are nature’s minstrels, flitting deftly between blossoming branches and filling the air with their melodious chirps.

Much like them, I hope this project moves with lively precision and harmony in its realm. 🌸🎶
