# Bulbula


### Why the name ?

This project is named after the vibrant ‡¨¨‡≠Å‡¨≤‡¨¨‡≠Å‡¨≤‡¨æ (BulabulƒÅ), affectionately known as the Indian bulbul. These spirited songbirds are nature‚Äôs minstrels, flitting deftly between blossoming branches and filling the air with their melodious chirps.

Much like them, I hope this project moves with lively precision and harmony in its realm. üå∏üé∂
